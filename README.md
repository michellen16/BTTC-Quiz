This project was completed during the summer 2023 semester at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
This was our final project for the CS 111 class.
I worked on this project with another student in my class, and we created it from scratch in response to a specific prompt.
We chose the prompt related to BTTC (Break Through Tech Chicago), a program that focuses on providing opportunities to women and non-binary individuals in the STEM field.
Our program asks the user a series of questions to determine if they would be a good fit for this program.
This project demonstrates our skills in Python and Turtle Graphics.
The project was also selected to be part of the CS 111 Final Project Showcase.

All the backend code can be found in 'main.py'.
The other files are visuals and data for the frontend.
